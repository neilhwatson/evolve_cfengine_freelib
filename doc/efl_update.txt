Intro

This is a work in progress. It should be considered beta quality. Efl_update.cf
is an alternative the CFEngine Community's stock update.cf.

Features

Reduces sever load when updating the inputs directory.

Starts or restarts CFEngine daemons as required.

More transparent that cf_promises_validated mechanism.

Promises inputs permissions.

Uses redundant policy servers with network load balancing.

On the server, Cf-manifext reads masterfiles and builds a file, default name
efl_manifest.txt, that contains file names and their hashes. Elf_update.cf
downloads the manifest file and reads it comparing its contents with existing
inputs.  If any files differ or are missing the agent promises to download
them from the policy server.

Short server setup

* Install efl_update.cf to masterfiles/.
* Install cf-manifest to modules/.
* Allow agent access to modules via access serer promises.
* Add a commands promise in your policy to run cf-manifest on policy servers.
* Change exec_command in executor control body to call efl_update.cf instead of
update.cf.

Notes

* Only .txt, .tmp, and .cf inputs files are considered. If you wish to change
this you'll have to edit cf-manifest and efl_update.cf.
* WARNING, This affects how inputs are updated. If something goes wrong you
may have to update inputs on all clients by hand. Test very, very carefully.

Server setup using Evolve free promise library

* Install evolve_freelib.cf to lib/ in masterfiles and put in inputs in
promises.cf.
* Install return_index.pl to modules/.
* Plus the short setup above, except building your own command promise.
* Create dirs efl_data/bundle_params/ in masterfiles.
* Create file efl_data/bundle_params/main.txt with this line:
any ;; Run commands ;; efl_command ;; 1 ;; ${sys.workdir}/inputs/efl_data/bundle_params/efl_command.txt ;; efl commands
* Create file efl_data/bundle_params/efl_command.txt with this line:
am_policy_hub ;; ${sys.workdir}/modules/cf-manifest ;; no ;; no ;; 1 ;; efl_update for cfengine
* Call the bundle efl_main from your policy via method or bundlesequence with
the parameter ${sys.workdir}/inputs/efl_data/bundle_params/main.txt.
Example from stock promises.cf:


bundle agent main
{
 methods:

  any::

   "INIT MSG" usebundle => init_msg,
                comment => "Just a pre-defined policy bundled with the package",
                 handle => "main_methods_any_init_msg";

   "EFL Main"
      usebundle => efl_main( "${sys.workdir}/inputs/efl_data/bundle_params/main.txt" ),
      comment   => "Run email main looper bundle",
      handle    => "main_methods_andy_elf_main";
}

Redundant policy servers

Efl_update reads the file ${sys.workdir}/efl_policy_servers.dat. This file is
in the format of one hostname or IP address per line, comments using '#' are
permitted. Each host is read into a list which is shuffled deterministically,
on each agent host.  The list is used in copy_from bodies. If the file does
not exist then the CFEngine standard file ${sys.workdir}/policy_server.dat} is
used.

Efl_policy_servers.dat can be created any you wish, but a template files
promise, with empty as a default, is recommended. Template example:

# Redundant policy servers
[%CFEngine !dmz_example_com %]
vega.example.com
sirius.example.com

[%CFEngine dmz_example_com %]
pluto.dmz.example.com
oort.dmz.example.com

use the config bundle.
